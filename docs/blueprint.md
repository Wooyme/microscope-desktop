# **App Name**: Session Weaver

## Core Features:

- Session Creation: Create a new game session with basic details like game name and players.
- Period and Event Nodes: Add and edit Periods and Events as connected nodes on ReactFlow ("@xyflow/react": "^12.8.6").
- Legacy Edges: Define Legacies by creating edges to link Periods, Events, and other Legacies to map the relationships on the ReactFlow canvas.
- Narrative Review: Enter review mode to explore the session's narrative structure as visualized by the ReactFlow diagram.
- AI-Powered Connection Suggestions: The tool analyzes existing Periods, Events and Legacies and suggests potential new Legacies by connecting existing nodes.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#89B4FA), reminiscent of ink on parchment.
- Background color: Light grey (#F0F2F5) for a neutral backdrop that allows the narrative elements to stand out.
- Accent color: Muted purple (#A389FA) to highlight interactive elements.
- Headline font: 'Playfair' serif for headings; body font: 'PT Sans' sans-serif. 'Playfair' gives an elegant feel to headers while 'PT Sans' ensures body text is easily readable.
- Use minimalist icons for representing Periods, Events, and Legacies.
- Employ a clean and intuitive layout within ReactFlow, with drag-and-drop functionality and clear visual hierarchy.
- Use subtle animations when connecting nodes or revealing details in review mode.
